# Caitlin Stevenson | Employee Management System (EMS) Assignment

## Objectives

In this project, I created an employee management system that allows a user to view, add, and update employees, job roles, and departments via their command line. To achieve this functionality I used three NodeJS packages: Inquirer, MySQL2, and Console-Table.

## User Instruction

A user will need to run `npm install` in their terminal once they have cloned down the repo to get started. The user will also need to create and seed their database using the provided `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files in the `db` folder and add their personal user and password to the connection function at the bottom of the `server.js` file. They can then initiate the application in the command line by running `node server.js`.
